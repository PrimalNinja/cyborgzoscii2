An innovative character encoding system that eliminates lookup table overhead while providing built-in security properties through direct memory addressing.

## Overview

CyborgZOSCII is an alternative to ASCII/PETSCII that uses direct ROM addressing instead of traditional character-to-value mapping. This approach provides significant advantages for resource-constrained systems while offering unique security properties.

## microZOSCII

microZOSCII is a ZOSCII-derived, Quantum Proof mechanism to bootstrap full ZOSCII.

**ZOSCII: Where information theory meets practical engineering, and encryption becomes obsolete.**
